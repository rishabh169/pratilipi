      Dark is a German drama on Netflix about time travel and confused teenagers. But if you were constructing a course about its themes, Item 1 on the syllabus would be the variable concepts of responsibility and free will; Item 1a would be multigenerational trauma. I guess I no longer need to describe Dark as grim—central to the plot is the unexplainable disappearance of two young boys in the small town of Winden—but the show’s preoccupation is whether or not we’re doomed to repeat past mistakes.

Other salient questions: How far in the past? How past is the past? How changeable are the present and future? There’s a nuclear power plant in Winden; in the first episode, a fuzzy radio broadcast congratulates the town on never having an incident. Yet every 30 years or so, birds fall from the sky and dead livestock dot the fields.</p>
